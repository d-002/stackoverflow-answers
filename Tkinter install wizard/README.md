# install-wizard

This is a rudimentary tkinter installer that is basically just a proof of concept used here:  
https://stackoverflow.com/q/74359083#74366953

The files in the `.zip` are all the files needed in order to run `application.exe` (tkinter application that displays a *Hello World*).  
The exe file is also in the `.zip`.

The installer will download, extract and remove `application.zip` into a local directory that the user set.  

I also provided the application in text format as `application.pyw`.

... I know the installer is ugly but as I said it's just a proof of concept.
